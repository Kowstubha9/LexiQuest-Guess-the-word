# üó∫Ô∏è LexiQuest: The Word Quest Adventure



**LexiQuest** is a full-stack, Wordle-style guessing game built with a secure, multi-user architecture. Players strive to decipher a 5-letter hidden word in five attempts or less. The project is designed with a strong separation between client-side and server-side responsibilities, featuring robust user management and comprehensive administrator reporting tools.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Role-Based Access:** Separate environments for **Player** (game access) and **Admin** (reports access).
* **Secure Authentication:** User registration enforced with minimum length, alpha, numeric, and specific special character requirements (`$, %, *, @`).
* **Themed UI:** Uses a warm **Parchment and Antique Gold** color palette to evoke a "Word Quest" theme.
* **Core Game Mechanics:**
    * **Feedback:** Implements Green (Correct/Position), Orange (Correct/Wrong Position), and Grey (Not in Word) tile feedback.
    * **Constraints:** Enforces a maximum of **3 words** to guess per user per day, and **5 guesses** per word.
* **Admin Reporting:**
    * **Daily Summary:** View the total unique players and total wins for a selected date.
    * **User History:** Case-insensitive search to fetch detailed history for any player (date, games tried, wins).
    * **Global Rankings (Enhancement):** Overview of total games played and total wins for all players.
